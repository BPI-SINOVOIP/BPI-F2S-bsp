Sunplus SP7021 series SoC PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sunplus,sp7021-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- clocks: phandle to the PWM source clock

Example:

pwm: pwm@0x9c007480 {
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
	compatible = "sunplus,sp7021-pwm";
	reg = <0x9c007480 0x80>;
	clocks = <&sysslow>;
};
