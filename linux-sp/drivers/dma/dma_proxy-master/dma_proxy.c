/* DMA Proxy
 *
 * This module is designed to be a small example of a DMA device driver that is
 * a client to the DMA Engine using the AXI DMA driver. It serves as a proxy for
 * kernel space DMA control to a user space application.
 *
 * A zero copy scheme is provided by allowing user space to mmap a kernel allocated
 * memory region into user space, referred to as a proxy channel interface. The
 * ioctl function is provided to start a DMA transfer which then blocks until the
 * transfer is complete. No input arguments are being used in the ioctl function.
 *
 * There is an associated user space application, dma_proxy_test.c, and dma_proxy.h
 * that work with this device driver.
 *
 * The hardware design was tested with an AXI DMA without scatter gather and
 * with the transmit channel looped back to the receive channel.
 *
