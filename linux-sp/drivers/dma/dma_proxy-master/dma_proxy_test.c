/* DMA Proxy Test Application
 *
 * This application is intended to be used with the DMA Proxy device driver. It provides
 * an example application showing how to use the device driver to do user space DMA
 * operations.
 *
 * It has been tested with an AXI DMA system with transmit looped back to receive.
 * The device driver implements a blocking ioctl() function such that a thread is
 * needed for the 2nd channel. Since the AXI DMA transmit is a stream without any
 * buffering it is throttled until the receive channel is running.
